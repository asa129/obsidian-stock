## Onboarding

Once you have Windsurf running, you will see the page below. Let’s get started! Note that you can always restart this onboarding flow with the “Reset Onboarding” command.

### 1\. Select setup flow

If you’re coming from VS Code or Cursor, you can easily import your configurations. Otherwise, select “Start fresh”. You can also optionally install `windsurf` in PATH such that you can run `windsurf` from your command line.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/codeium/assets/windsurf/onboarding/setup.png)

Choose your keybindings here, either default VS Code bindings or Vim bindings.

### 2\. Choose editor theme

Choose your favorite color theme from these defaults! Don’t worry, you can always change this later. Note that if you imported from VS Code, your imported theme will override this.

### 3\. Sign up / Log in

To use Windsurf, you need to use your Windsurf account or create one if you don’t have one. Signing up is completely free!
